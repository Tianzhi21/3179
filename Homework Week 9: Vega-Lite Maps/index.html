    <h1>Total patent application related to AI as in 2020</h1>

    <!-- Description/Remark Section -->
    <p>
        This visualization represents the total number of patent applications related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) across different countries in the year 2020. 
        The map is color-coded based on the number of patent applications, with a darker color indicating a higher number of patents.
        The data has been sourced from international patent databases and is focused on patent applications specifically related to AI technologies.
        Countries without available data are displayed in light gray.
